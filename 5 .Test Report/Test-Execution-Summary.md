# Test Execution Summary for OrangeHRM Manual Testing

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an in-depth summary of the manual testing efforts performed for the OrangeHRM application, focusing on critical modules such as the Login Page, Leave Application, and Employee Management (PIM Module). The testing cycle was conducted over a one-week period with the objective of verifying the application's functional integrity, ensuring compliance with business requirements, and identifying areas for improvement. The report details the testing process, outcomes, defect analysis, and recommendations based on the findings.

## 2. Test Execution Details

**Testing Period:** December 10, 2024 â€“ December 16, 2024
(A one-week testing cycle that provided adequate time for test execution, defect reporting, and re-testing.)

**Test Environment:**
* Platform: Web-based OrangeHRM Demo Site
* Browser: Google Chrome
* Operating System: Windows (Laptop)
* Testing Methodology: Manual functional testing using a structured test case-based approach with exploratory techniques

## 3. Test Case Execution Status

* Total Test Cases Executed: 114
* Passed: 102
* Failed: 12
* Blocked/Skipped: None

## 4. Defect Summary

A total of 12 defects were identified during the testing cycle. The defects ranged across various severity levels:

* **Critical:** 2 defects (e.g., major issues on the login page preventing access for valid users)
* **High:** 4 defects (e.g., functional errors within the leave application process)
* **Medium:** 4 defects (e.g., inconsistencies in employee data entry in the PIM module)
* **Low:** 2 defects (e.g., minor UI/UX issues and alignment discrepancies)

Most defects have been documented with clear reproduction steps and have either been resolved or are in progress. Detailed bug reports are maintained separately and referenced as part of the overall defect management process.

## 5. Key Findings & Observations

* The majority of the test cases passed, indicating that core functionalities like login, leave application, and employee addition are generally robust
* Critical and high-severity issues were primarily related to data validation and error handling in key modules
* Minor UI discrepancies were observed, but they did not affect the overall functionality
* The functional testing approach helped uncover hidden defects, especially in form validations and workflow transitions within modules

## 6. Test Coverage Analysis

* **Coverage:** Approximately 100% of the planned test cases were executed
* **Requirement Traceability:** Each test case was mapped to the specific functional requirements, ensuring that all key business processes for login, leave management, and employee management were adequately covered
* **Observations:** The high pass rate (102 out of 114 test cases) reflects a good level of stability in the application; however, the defects identified underline areas for further improvement and refinement

## 7. Challenges & Mitigation

* **Challenge:** Occasional downtime or inconsistent performance from the demo site posed challenges during test execution
   * **Mitigation:** Testing was scheduled flexibly within the one-week period, and multiple test runs were conducted when the system performance stabilized

* **Challenge:** Limited access to advanced testing tools required reliance on Excel for defect tracking
   * **Mitigation:** A well-organized Excel sheet with clear columns for defect ID, severity, status, and reproduction steps ensured effective defect management

* **Challenge:** Managing multiple modules with diverse functionality
   * **Mitigation:** A structured test case approach combined with exploratory testing ensured comprehensive coverage across modules

## 8. Conclusion & Recommendations

### Overall Result:
The testing cycle was successfully completed with a high pass rate, indicating that the core functionalities of the OrangeHRM application are reliable. However, the defects reported, particularly in critical and high-severity areas, need prompt resolution to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Recommendations:
* Address critical defects immediately, especially those affecting the login functionality and core business workflows
* Perform regression testing once defects are resolved to ensure no new issues have been introduced
* Consider integrating automated testing for repetitive tasks in future cycles to enhance efficiency
* Regularly update test cases and documentation to align with evolving business requirements and system updates
